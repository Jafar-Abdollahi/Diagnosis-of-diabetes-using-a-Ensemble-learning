# Diagnosis-of-diabetes-using-a-Ensemble-learning
<h2> Methods </h2>
In this project, Ensemble learning algorithms with a combination of hybrid feature selection are used to more accurately diagnose and predict diabetes. The results show that the proposed method has a higher performance than the basic methods and has reached 93% accuracy.

<h2> Suggested method </h2>
The use of machine learning technology has become increasingly popular in recent years, as machine learning is the science that computers learn without integrating programming using training data that is already trainable. In this paper, we use a group learning approach that proposes a reinforcement algorithm to improve the prediction accuracy of diabetes mellitus. Before using this method, we use a hybrid feature selection approach to find features that have more variance in the rapid diagnosis of diabetes, to obtain prediction accuracy using hybrid feature selection results.

<h2> Conclusion </h2>
In this study, we have analyzed open health issues with various solutions and we have seen in many cases that smart health can help improve health care by continuously monitoring the elderly and paving the way for smart health. Finally, our proposed approach, after evaluating and comparing with the basic algorithms, it has been shown to be advanced compared to the above methods and the accuracy achieved with this model is 93%. Table 5 shows the best modeling results with different classification techniques.
