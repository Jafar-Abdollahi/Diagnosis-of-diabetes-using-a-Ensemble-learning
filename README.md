# Diagnosis-of-diabetes-using-a-Ensemble-learning
In this project, Ensemble learning algorithms with a combination of hybrid feature selection are used to more accurately diagnose and predict diabetes. The results show that the proposed method has a higher performance than the basic methods and has reached 93% accuracy.
